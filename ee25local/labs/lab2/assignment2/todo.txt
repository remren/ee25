+ Implement ALU Controls
- Implement ALU
    + 0000: AND
    + 0001: OR
    + 0010: Add
        + Overflow?
            in0 msb | in1 msb | result msb | overflow
            0         0         0            0
            0         0         1            1      
            1         1         
            1         0         1            0
            1         0         1            0
            1         0         1            0
            
            (in0 nxor in1) and (result xor in0)

    + 0110: Subtract (minuend, subtrahend)
        + 1s complement of subtrahend
        + 2s complement (add 1) of subtrahend
        + result is difference
        + Overflow, is it just sign difference?
            Overflow not fully tested. Can't think of a good case, got peabrain
    + 0111: Pass Input b
    + 1100: NOR
